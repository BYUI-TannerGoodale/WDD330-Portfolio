            <h3>Clients and servers</h3>
            <p class="question">How do clients and servers interact with each other?</p>
            <p>
                Traditional web apps have a client communicate with an external server and the server send information to the client
                depending on what was requested. This pattern is handled via routing on a server and often includes a data layer handled
                by a database. Each request for data would require the page to reload in order for the server data to render on the 
                client side. This method is still commonly in use and is the underlying backbone of backend web development.

            <h3>A brief history of Ajax</h3>
            <p class="question">What is Ajax and where did it come from?</p>
            <p>
                Ajax is a JavaScript method that allows client devices to request server data and dynamically change a part of the website
                using that data without reloading the page. Ajax largely changed the way many web apps would behave, making them dynamic
                in nature rather than static.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ajax, or the early form of it, started back in 1999 with Microsoft's XMLHTTP ActiveX control on internet explorer 5.
                It's funny that IE would be the browser to change the world, at least from our prospective today. Back then, IE was 
                one of the best browsers available. Asynchronous loading gained a lot more attention in 2004 and 2005 with Google's 
                Gmail and Google Maps. These simple web applications were revolutionary for their time, as they didn't refresh the page
                when getting new data. This was more reminiscent of the desktop applications of days yonder past.
            </p>
            <p>
                The phrase Ajax would be coined in 2005 by Jesse James Garrett, who wrote about Google's use of the technology.
                Ajax is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript XML. XML is not commonly used anymore, as JSON took over as the data
                transfer protocol standard. The original vehicle for this type of request, the XMLHttpRequest object.

            <h3>Communicating with the server using the Fetch API</h3>
            <p class="question">What is the Fetch API and how does it differ from the XMLHttpRequest Object?</p>
            <p>
                The Fetch API is a living standard for Ajax protocol now days. It has almost replaced the XMLHttpRequest Object
                completely, though rare situations might call for using the older method. The Fetch API uses promises to avoid 
                callback hell and also streamlines a number of common tasks from the older method.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that has one mandatory argument, the URL of the website you want to fetch
                from.
            </p>
            <code>
                fetch('https://example.com/data')
                .then( // code that handles the response )
                .catch( // code that runs if the server returns an error )
            </code>
            <p>
                The Fetch API introduced the response interface which essentially returns a response object when the promise is fulfilled.
                This response object has a number of its own properties that can indicate the nature of the response. This is important
                because so long as the Fetch promise receives any feedback from the requested server, it says that it's OK.
                The OK property is true when a response is successful. If there is no communication with the server, then the response 
                will fail and the catch will be fired. No response object will be returned in this case. OK is only set to true when
                a server sends a response and the status code is between 200 and 299.
            </p>
            <code>
                fetch('https://example.com/data')
                .then((response) => {
                    // If the response code is between 200 and 299, ok will be set to true.
                    if(response.ok) {
                        return response;
                    }
                    // This code would run if ok was not set to true.
                    throw Error(response.statusText);
                })
                .then( response => // do something with response )
                .catch( error => console.log('There was an error!') )
            </code>
            <p><i>
                Some other properties of the Response object are:
                <br>
                headers – A Headers object (see later section) containing any headers associated with the response
                url – A string containing the URL of response
                redirected – A boolean value that specifies if the response is the result of a redirect
                type – A string value of 'basic', 'cors', 'error' or 'opaque'. A value of 'basic' is used for a response from the 
                same domain. A value of 'cors' means the data was received from a valid cross-origin request from a different domain. 
                A value of 'opaque' is used for a response received from 'no-cors' request from another domain, which means access 
                to the data will be severely restricted. A value of 'error' is used when a network error occurs.
                <br>
                The response object also contains a number of methods that return promises that can then be chained together.
            </i></p>
            <p>
                When dealing with the Fetch API, many online resources can provide a comprehensive list of properties and methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many different data types that can be returned with the Fetch API, but the most common is JSON.
                JSON is useful because it is native to JavaScript and can be easily manipulated once resolved into an object.
            </p>
            <code>
                fetch(url)
                .then( response => response.json() ); // transforms the JSON data into a JavaScript object
                .then( data => console.log(Object.entries(data)) )
                .catch( error => console.log('There was an error: ', error))
            </code>
            <p>
                Along with specifying, retrieving (and even making) response objects, you can also work with request objects.
                Request objects allow you to get more fine tuned power over how the Fetch API will request data from the url.
                They can be made using a request constructor function. An example will be shown below.
            </p>
            <code>
                const request = new Request('https://example.com/data', {
                    method: 'GET',
                    mode: 'cors',
                    redirect: 'follow',
                    cache: 'no-cache'
                });
            </code>
            <p>
                Alternatively, you can make a request literal by supplying the same information directly in the fetch methods parentheses.
            </p>
            <code>
                fetch('https://example.com/data', {
                    method: 'GET',
                    mode: 'cors',
                    redirect: 'follow',
                    cache: 'no-cache'
                })
                .then( // do something with the response )
                .catch( // handle any errors)
            </code>

            <h3>Receiving Information</h3>
            <p class="question">How do we receive and use information with the Fetch API?</p>
            <p>
                Being able to receive information from an external server asynchronously is at the heart of Ajax. After all, you can't
                update a website with no data. Well, you can, but it wont be good. To really see the power of Ajax, we will have to go to
                this <a href="../activities/ch13/ajax.html">activity page</a>.

            <h3>Sending Information and Form Data</h3>
            <p class="question">What can you send to an API server?</p>
            <p>
                I've long had interest in creating a "server-less" web app that would run on the front end and use Ajax to send and
                retrieve data to and from a database server (probably through an external API server, so not truly server-less). this
                would include login functionality as well as business logic handling, all using Ajax and a remote server/database.
                I don't know if this is possible at the level described, hopefully the reading here will clarify this.
            </p>
            <p>
                After reading a few paragraphs in, I can see that my goal is absolutely possible.
