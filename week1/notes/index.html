        Localstorage seems like it would be usefull for reducing the load on servers an databases, at least for user centric temporary data
        like contents of a shoppig cart or somthing along those lines. I can see that it's no replacement for a database though, as a database
        would hold infrmation that was more in line with business or server needs that would need to be kept indefinitely.

        <h2>Questions to answer</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>How can I store data so it isnâ€™t lost when the application stops?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A database can store various inputs from a user and can also aid in delivering outputs.</li>
                    <li>Localstorage can save data on a client device much like a cookie, but that won't be deleted 
                        when the website instace is ended. It uses name-value pairs like a session or cookie as well.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>How do I get data back into my application once it has been stored?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript has built in methods that can call data saved on localStorage. You only need define where
                        that data goes.
                    </li>
                    <li>An API call to a database or a server connected to one can do similar things, but with data that is stored
                        off the client and is not always in a key-value pair.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>What can I do to allow the user to communicate?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Giving the user input options through some form is the standard way to set up communication.</li>
                    <li>Event listeners can also be used to get ques from a user.</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            A lot of the reading material is mostly review, outside of never actually using localStorage before. It's been a long time
            sense I've touched the front end of web development. I've spent the past few semesters building backend structures and
            using frameworks. It's feels kind of funny to be doing native development now. A lot of the ideas in backend development
            seem to transfer over to the front end without much effort though.
        </p>

            Local storage seems well enough for data that dosen't need to be secure. It seems to be very similar to a cookie
            or session, only lasting longer in memory.
