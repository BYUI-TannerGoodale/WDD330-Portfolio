        Localstorage seems like it would be usefull for reducing the load on servers an databases, at least for user centric temporary data
        like contents of a shoppig cart or somthing along those lines. I can see that it's no replacement for a database though, as a database
        would hold infrmation that was more in line with business or server needs that would need to be kept indefinitely.

        <h2>Questions to answer</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>How can I store data so it isnâ€™t lost when the application stops?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A database can store various inputs from a user and can also aid in delivering outputs.</li>
                    <li>Localstorage can save data on a client device much like a cookie, but that won't be deleted 
                        when the website instace is ended. It uses name-value pairs like a session or cookie as well.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>How do I get data back into my application once it has been stored?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript has built in methods that can call data saved on localStorage. You only need define where
                        that data goes.
                    </li>
                    <li>An API call to a database or a server connected to one can do similar things, but with data that is stored
                        off the client and is not always in a key-value pair.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>What can I do to allow the user to communicate?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Giving the user input options through some form is the standard way to set up communication.</li>
                    <li>Event listeners can also be used to get ques from a user.</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            A lot of the reading material is mostly review, outside of never actually using localStorage before. It's been a long time
            sense I've touched the front end of web development. I've spent the past few semesters building backend structures and
            using frameworks. It's feels kind of funny to be doing native development now. A lot of the ideas in backend development
            seem to transfer over to the front end without much effort though.
        </p>
        <p>
            Local storage seems well enough for data that dosen't need to be secure. It seems to be very similar to a cookie
            or session, only lasting longer in memory.

        <p>"If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content, and your core functionality.
            That leads to simple, beautiful apps. If you do it the other way around, it'll be like trying to push a marshmallow into a
            piggy bank, wich is neither simple, nor beautiul." Jole Marsh - The Hipper Element.
            <br><br>
            I haven't thought of it like this before. I think it's a brilliant way to focus on content and a good philosophy in general.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wonder if it would be easier to develop mobile first if we built in a mock-mobile enviornment first. It sort of forces the
            developer to focus on what is in front of them that way. Mobile first is future proofing, afterall. It's not going anywhere.
            I know for my personal browsing, I use mobile. My computer is used for development and games. That's pretty mcuh it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Immediate, Relevant, Frictionless. Immediate means to "be there" or to keep up with the trends and not fall behind. You will
            become obsolete before you know it. Relevant means be usefull. People are shy, they won't tell you if they are dissatisfied
            with your site. You need to provide usefull information. Frictionless and quick. The site should not only load fast, but
            preform tasks fast. To do this, you can reduce the congnative load and make the application intuitive and "mindless".
        </p>
        <p>
            A note for mobile develoment, people have to reach the interactive parts of the website. Make them easy to reach. Seems obvious,
            but I didn't even think of it. Interactive portions should be in thumbs reach, often towards the bottom and further from the center.
        </p>
        <p>Speed is the life line of an application. A slow app will loose users quickly. Optomize your website to run fast and use
            minimal resources. This is especially true of mobile first builds, which translates to faster desktop apps as well. Be aware
            of your user's potential network limitatins. Reduce the use of images and stick to web freidnly ones if you need them.
            SVG and Webfonts are good low resource assests to use. Optimize and minimize CSS and JS files. Clean them up.
        </p>
        <p>Look into GZIP for minimizing data.</p>
        <p>Don't be afraid to break normal design standards if it makes the app ore useable. For example, put the menu in the bottom in a mobile app.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Look into float lables for form fields, what sort of witchcraft is that?!</strong></p>
        <p>Checkboxes and event listeners to populate form fields, look into that. How would the database handle that? Nullable columns?
            That begs the question, what is the minimal ammount of data we need from the user? Break the forms down to their smallest usefull
            sect and gather data that is needed. Autofill is also a good standard.
        </p>
        <p>Hiding passwords in forms isn't intuitive. Show the password and allow the user to hide it if they need. If you can integrate
            passwordless handlers, such as touch ID passcode bypass (on select client devices) or whatever the user hardware permits.
            Auto advancing forms such as Frost's credit card form can also be very usefull for user interaction. Use semantic HTML5 and 
            JavaScript to allow proper keyboard types to be sent on form fields as well.
        </p>
        <p>Make phone nubers and emails smart by putting them in an anchor tag or some interactive tag that the user dosen't have to 
            manually handle themselves.
        </p>
        <p>Unabtrusive and simple ads are more effective than big bulky anger iducing ads. Never use a popup, ever. Seriously.
            Users don't come to your site for ads, they come for your content. Use ads sparingly and you'll have more sucsess and more
            coversion rates for those who advertise off of your platform.
