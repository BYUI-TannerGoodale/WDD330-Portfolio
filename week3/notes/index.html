        <h2>JavaScript’s "this" method.</h2>
        <p>Pre reading note: I've used the this method in other languages before. With any luck, JavaScript's will work the same.</p>
        <p>
            It’s nice to see that JavaScript objects behave much the same way as objects in other languages. It’s interesting to 
            see in the example how they defined an object literal, then defined a property that wasn’t defined in the initial 
            creation and applied a method to it (or function to create a method). I was thinking this would throw an error, but 
            JavaScript just adds the method and allows a user to call it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wonder if the way the method is declared changes its scope and behavior sense it’s inside of an object. For example, 
            they used a function expression when they defined their method. Would that have worked differently if they used a 
            function declaration? Does it make a difference if it is an object method?
        </p>
        <p>
            Creating object literals is fine for shot code, but creating classes would be ideal for longer and larger applications 
            that use objects. Is JavaScript capable of defining classes and using constructor methods? A quick google search shows 
            that it can create classes and even implements a default constructor if you don’t define a specific one. This was a 
            feature added in ES6.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would prefer to define methods inside of my object declaration or inside of the class that defines it. With that 
            being said, the method shorthand version sees to be more intuitive than the longer “property : function() {..}; method”. 
            The website mentions small differences when it comes to class inheritance though. I wonder what those differences are.
        </p>
        <p>
            The way “this” works in JavaScript objects seems to be the same way it works in other languages. It allows JavaScript 
            to actually practice Object Oriented Principles. Without the “this” keyword, OOP wouldn’t actually work all that will 
            in JavaScript. With that being said, it behaving differently outside of objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            The “this” keyword can be defined outside of an object, but the method it is defined with only really works assuming 
            it is tied to (called with) a valid object that has the necessary properties. It just seems like another weakly typed 
            feature of JavaScript. It allows a method defined with “this” to be used on multiple objects, even if they seem 
            unrelated, but allows for more room for error. I suppose it’s a net positive in the end though.
        </p>
        <p>
            Part one of the activites will be playing with the "this" keyword. Many notes in comments in code.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 5 Notes</h2>
        <p>
            Continuing on from the first section, I find it interesting that objects can have property names that don’t HAVE to 
            follow variable naming conventions. So long as it is wrapped in quotes, it can be used. I would think that this method 
            would break dot notation, however and generally be less desirable. I for one, will likely stick to variable naming 
            conventions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Properties can be removed from an object via the delete method. For example, “delete superman.fly;”. This would return 
            a bool value depending on success or failure. This permanently removed the property from the object. The property can 
            be readded manually if desired for some reason as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also nest objects; this works much as you would expect it to. Nested objects largely remind me of JSON packets. 
            As a matter of fact, I’m pretty sure you can turn nested objects into JSON data with a built-in method. JSON.stringify() 
            if I recall, and JSON.parse() to take JSON and make it JavaScript again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using objects as function parameters is something I’ve never thought of, but it makes perfect sense. The developer has 
            built in names and just supplies a value to each. This also makes it possible to enter names out of order. Though, I 
            thought we could use named parameters already. What is the difference? Well, objects can be passed still, definitely 
            something to take note of. NOTE: apparently this is using named parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Namespacing seems like it’ll be important. Essentially, it creates a massive object that holds related methods together. 
            I can see that being important when building a library that will be used by many other developers or when you need to 
            make portable code.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s nice to see that the stringify method will ignore object methods. This makes defining JSON a lot easier from a 
            development layout standpoint. Though it is important to understand the basic operations of a program before you start 
            writing it. Still, it’s an easy built-in feature. I wonder if there is a way you can pass method definitions though. 
            I suppose you would need a universal standard to translate it to useable code on whatever server it lands on.
            "These methods are particularly useful when it comes to sending data to, and receiving data from, a web server using Ajax 
            requests (see Chapter 13) – or when using localStorage to store data on a user’s machine" -From the Readings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Date objects have private properties that can only be accessed via getters. I wonder if we can declare user defined 
            objects with private properties. Also, does that mean that the date objects have setters? Or are the properties only 
            set when the constructor method is called?
        </p>
        <p>
            Reading on, I find that most of the getter methods have corresponding setter methods as well. Note that the timestamp 
            returned in many of the methods can be seen as a normal date by entering the .toString() method on the date object.
            "Working with dates and timezones can be tricky. Themoment.js librarygives you a large number of methods that make it 
            easier to work with dates, as well as support for multiple locales." - From the Readings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regular expressions have long been the bane of me. Still, they’re very useful for front end validation and can even be 
            used on the server side for secondary validation. I’ll have to learn how to use them and learn to enjoy it too.. 
            As per usual, the preferred way to create a regular expression (as with almost any object) is to use a literal. Still, 
            the constructor can create a regexp from a variable or user input, so I can see that being important on dynamic features.
        </p>
        <p>
            Groups of characters are tracked by placing them inside of a set of square brackets. For example, [aeiou] will track vowels 
            and [qwstr] will check if a latter in that section of the regexp is either q, w, s, t or r. Sequences can be tracked using 
            a dash “-“.  Regexp are case sensitive by default and can be made case insensitive by appending “i” to the end of the regexp. 
            This is because regexp are objects and have built in methods. “g” is also a method and it returns all matching cases, 
            not just the first one. “m” allows the regexp to read multiple lines. An example of using one of the methods is as follows, 
            “pattern = /java/i”.
        </p>
        <p>Metacharacters as defined in the readings (JavaScript novice to ninja 2nd edition)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>. matches any character, except line breaks</li>
            <li>\w matches any word character, and is equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_]</li>
            <li>\W matches any non-word character, and is equivalent to [\^A-Za-z0-9_]</li>
            <li>\d matches any digit character, and is equivalent to [0-9]</li>
            <li>\D matches any non-digit character, and is equivalent to [^0-9]</li>
            <li>\s matches any whitespace character, and is equivalent to [ \t\r\n\f]</li>
            <li>\S matches any non-whitespace character, and is equivalent to [^ \t\r\n\f]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Modifiers as defined in the readings (JavaScript novice to ninja 2nd edition)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>? makes the preceding token in the regular expression optional</li>
            <li>* matches one or more occurrences of the preceding token</li>
            <li>+ matches one or more occurrences of the preceding token</li>

            <li>{,m} matches at mostmoccurrences of the preceding token</li>
            <li>{n,m} matches at leastnand at mostmoccurrences of the preceding token</li>
            <li>^ marks the position immediately before the first character in the string</li>
            <li>$ marks the position immediately after the last character in the string</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Special characters and modifiers need to be escaped using a backslash. Without a backslash, they can not be matched in a regexp.</p>
        <p>
            The following regexp would match any word that starts with a capital letter and dosen't have numbers in it (I think).
            "^[A-Z][a-z]*\D$". This is the case when tested on <a href="https://regex101.com/">https://regex101.com/</a>. This is
            tested in the activites under part one. and found in the soucres tab under part1.js.
        </p>
        <p>
            After going through the ninja quiz, I am starting to have second doubts about my understanding of “this” in JavaScript. 
            I think I’ll look at a few quick tutorials online and see if that clarifies things a bit. It could also be that I just 
            woke up and got almost no sleep last night too. Either way, I need to understand it to the core. Ok, it’s pretty much 
            what I thought it was, except I learned about the bind method that lets me bind “this” from a function to an object. 
            Lets try using the bid method in the sandbox.

        <h2>DOM Manipulation</h2>
        <p>
            Most of this chapter sees to be review. I'll go back and note anything of intrest. I do find it funny that getElementById() is
            over 20 years old as of this point. I wonder if it's been refined in the background at all ovr the years. Not that there is 
            much too it, of course.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was unaware of the nodeType method. I have a hard time seeing a practical use for it now days, but I’m sure 
            something like verifying the source of user input would be an example. Or maybe iterating through the page and 
            changing elements with a particular node type. Still, not a very practical tool on the surface, but when I consider 
            styling, perhaps there is some room for fun too.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve seen document.querySelector() before but never got around to using it too often. I think I’ll start using it 
            more and try to phase away from the older methods. I predict that querySelector() is going to be supported long 
            after getElemnetById(), granted I can’t see that one going out of common use any time soon. What I find the most 
            promising is the ability to use querySelector() on any element, not just the document.
        </p>
        <p>
            I use getAttribute and setAttribute often, even with that being said, I was always under the impression you had 
            to at least define the attribute in the html file before you tried to set it. I guess I can hold back on that 
            and use the setAttribute method to create and populate elements too. When it comes to classes in particular, 
            I can see a lot of use for the className and classList methods. I’ll have to try using those next time I want 
            to modify class structure of an element.
        </p>
        <p>
            The classList() method seems particularly powerful. I had forgotten about toggling. I can see this being used 
            a lot when doing dynamic css modifications or creating hooks for JavaScript in the future. It could even be 
            useful for validation. The built-in returns seem very intuitive as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Didn’t Microsoft finally stop supporting IE? I hope it dies out soon, it’s only given headaches. A lot of the 
            modern methods will never see compatibility with IE, so I guess its days are numbered. Maybe Microsoft will stop 
            shipping it with their OS’s. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The chapter was largly review, noteable things were taken down, but even most of that was review. I still don't see 
            any advantage over my current methods of DOM Manipulation though.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class='container'>
        <h2>Events</h2>
        <p>
            I set up an event listener for the ninja quiz in past activites so that it would work on a button click. It was my prefered
            way of handeling a launch.
        </p>
        <p>
            I never went that far into event listeners on the front end. I usually work on the server and send data as it’s required. 
            As a result, my front-end code is pretty minimal and even a bit hacky at times. I was aware that you could assign event 
            listeners on the back-end, but didn’t realize that it was the standard preference. I suppose I really am out of touch 
            with front end development.
        </p>
        <p>
            addEventListener() is the modern standard for applying event listeners. This makes the job fairly easy and intuitive. 
            I can assign the element to a variable and use the addEventListener() method on it. Very useful.
        </p>
        <p>
            The keydown, keyup and keypress are events that I’ve used to force user input to fit in a regex before, but never in 
            vanilla JavaScript. For lack of time, I won’t try at the moment, but I would like to try to implement this strategy in 
            an upcoming code. I find it interesting that the keypress has more to do with the character entered then the actual 
            key itself. I suppose this would make key tracking an easy task, depending on what you’re doing with it that is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Touch events are interesting, but I have a hard time seeing how they could be used when the default behavior of a web 
            page seems to translate over fairly well as is. I suppose for custom events it would be useful and it was likely built 
            in to facilitate the “native” performance anyway. Still, it makes me wonder how could you use touch events to do 
            something practical.
        </p>
        <p>
            At first, preventDefault() seemed like a “shoot yourself in the foot” function, and after I read on, it still does. 
            With that being said, I can see how it would be useful in some rare situations where you really need a lot of customization 
            over the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Capturing and Bubbling. In a nutshell, bubbling goes from the target event and rides all the back “up” to the 
            document root. This will fire events going up along the way. Capturing goes in the opposite direction and goes “down” 
            the dom tree until it hits the target event, firing off events from parent elements along the way. Because both can be 
            useful, a third argument exists in addEventListener which is a Boolean value. If this is set to true, the event will be 
            handled by capturing, if it is false, it will be handled by bubbling. Bubbling is the default behavior. Events can both 
            capture and bubble, but you need to use the method twice to achieve this.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll update the ninja quiz in a second activity soon to use everything covered here.
