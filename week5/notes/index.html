            <h3>- Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h3>
            <!-- Start by asking a question related to the topic, follow with answers to that question. Follow pattern. -->
            <p class='question'>How does JavaScript handel errors?</p>
            <p>
                Errors can occur for a variety of reasons, most of which will be because of one three things, system errors, programmer 
                errors and user errors. It can be debated that user errors are still programmer errors, as a programmer should set up 
                safeguards and frameworks that prevent the user from being able to enter improper data.
            </p>
            <p>
                A key component of errors are exceptions. Exceptions are a special return type that return an error message according 
                to the conditions that created the error. Exceptions also return stack traces, which essentially track where the error 
                came from and the probable cause of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Warnings are akin to errors, though they don’t cause a program to crash. Most browsers will alert you to a warning and 
                point it out, but not all. Warnings can be more destructive than errors because they don’t stop code execution. Your 
                program could continue to operate with incorrect data and though it may appear to work, can produce fatal logic errors.

            <h3>- The importance of testing and debugging & Strict Mode</h3>
            <p class="question">What are some reasons to test and debug code?</p>
            <p>
                JavaScript used to handle errors by letting them silently die in the background, this of course caused errors to become 
                malignant timebombs that were hard to track down. Sense ECMAScript 3, JavaScript attempts to alert a developer to errors, 
                though it is not always successful. It is important to create “loud” failures in the development phase by setting up 
                systems to catch and report errors as soon as they occur. This makes debugging easier in the development process. 
                When in the production stage, it is important to let the program handle errors “gracefully”, so as not to impede 
                on user experience but also not hide the error.
            </p>
            <p>
                ECMAScript 6 introduced strict mode, which creates an environment that’s much less forgiving to sloppy code and treats 
                warnings as errors. Strict mode can be activated by placing the string ‘use strict’ at the top of your JavaScript file. 
                It can also be used inline on functions. When using a module, strict mode is on by default. A good practice is to place 
                all your code in a self-calling function that starts by being defined as strict.
            </p>
            <code>
                (function() {
                'use strict';
                // All your code would go inside this function
                }());
            </code>
            <p><i>
                This reminds me of the “Main” method in Java and C#. It launches itself, it’s static by definition, it’s also 
                technically public and returns void of itself. Obviously it’s not the same thing, but if this is considered good 
                practice, I can’t help but feel like JavaScript is evolving to become more like a traditional OOP language.
            </i></p>
            <p>
                Linting tools go a step above strict mode and enforce certain codding practices, including the style of code in some 
                cases. Linting tools can be added as a plugin to a text editor, found online or even installed on a development machine 
                via node package manager. Linting tools can be useful for teams, but they can also be a bit opinionated and don’t 
                guarantee that code will be error free. In general, your choice to use a linting tool depends on how tight of a 
                standard you want your code to hold to.
            </p>
            <p>
                When developing with error handling in mind, it’s also important to consider potential system errors such as browser 
                support of certain APIs and a user’s browser version. APIs are fantastic tools, but not every user will have compatible 
                browsers. In this case, it is important to add checks into your code to ensure that the API you want to reference is 
                supported by the user’s browser. A simple “if” statement is capable of checking for the API.
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                What would I do if a feature I implemented required the use of an API? Would I simply tell the user to update their 
                browser to use my web app, or would I have to create a workaround somehow? I suppose the solution will vary depending 
                on what needs to be done, a simple “please update your browser” message might be the final solution if all else fails 
                though.

            <h3>- Debugging in the browser</h3>
            <p class="question">How can the browser be used to debug code?</p>
            <p>
                In the old days of yore, JavaScript could be debugged in the browser using the alert method inline with the code. 
                Then the console.log method came about which worked in a very similar way. Most modern browsers now’a days have built 
                in debugging APIs that let you set breakpoints and track stack flow and variable values with relative ease. This is 
                the preferred method, as the older methods required inline code to debug. You can still use the debugger keyword in 
                your code, though most consoles can add a breakpoint using a GUI as well.
            </p>

            <h3>- Error Objects</h3>
            <p class="question">An error is an Object? Can we treat it like one?</p>
            <p>
                Errors are Objects in JavaScript. They can be treated like any other object and have built in methods and properties 
                as well. Each browser handles the properties a bit differently. The only consistently safe ones to use are “name” 
                (which defined the error object to be created, for example a RangeError or SyntaxError), “message” which defines the 
                error message to be sent and then “stack” which is non-standard and should not be used in production sites. 
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="container padd">
            <h3>- Throwing exceptions & Exception Handling</h3>
            <p class="question">How do we throw exceptions in JavaScript?</p>
            <p>
                Exception handling is a core component of any programming language. It allows a programmer to throw an error that 
                would otherwise be ignored by the JavaScript engine. The throw keyword is used to throw exceptions. Any JavaScript 
                expression can be thrown, though ideally a programmer will throw an error as these can be caught and delt with 
                appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
                Companions to the throw keyword, there are the “try”, “catch” and “finally” keywords. The Try-Catch behavior of 
                JavaScript essentially mirrors that of other languages. The code you want to try against is placed in the try block. 
                If an error is thrown in the try block, that error is sent to the catch block as a parameter. You can then reference 
                the various parts of the error object and handle the error as you wish in the catch block. It is then possible to use 
                the finally block, which will execute no matter what after the try and catch blocks, even if no error is thrown.
            </p>

            <h3>- Testing Frameworks</h3>
            <p class="question">What can JavaScript testing frameworks do for you?</p>
            <p>
                Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework that was developed by Facebook. It can be installed via node package 
                manager and has many built in functions and methods that aid in producing meaningful tests. In order to use it, you 
                want to create testing files that you store your code to be tested in. You then reference that code (often a function 
                or method) in the testing environment. You start by declaring a test and passing a string explaining the goal of the 
                test. You then pass an anonymous function that calls the expect function which you pass your function to be tested 
                into. This creates an expectation object that has built in methods called matchers, which allow you to evaluate 
                expected results.
            </p>
            <p>
                To preform one of these testes, you must navigate to the folder where the name.test.js file is (or files, as the case 
                may be) and then run the Jest -c {} command in the cmd. The -c {} is the configuration parameter in case you need to 
                adjust the framework’s behavior.
