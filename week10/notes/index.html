            <p class='question'>How can I use front end validation to help make clean Fetch requests?</p>
            <p>
                A large portion of my final will include using the Fetch API to send and retrieve data. In essence, I am building a 
                RESTful application without a real back end. I'm not totally sure how I can do this, but I will try to get an idea
                of the structure I'll need to support it. Sense there is no backend, I will have to use strict front end validation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I took a lot of interest in the Constraint Validation API. I'm thinking if I implement it along side the standard 
                HTML5 validation, I can build something that holds it's own with relative ease. Still, it might be a good idea to 
                build a separate module to handle "server side" validation. I'm not sure if that's possible, but I can try.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now for the meat of it, front end validation is the first layer of protection for an application's most vulnerable
                part, data access and entry. Forms can be an easy first choice for hackers to attack, as they already connect to 
                the server's database handling. Front end validation enforces input types, making a user enter the proper data.
                HTML5 has build in types that can be used and when paired with the Constraint Validation API, they can be quite useful.
                This is a long cry from the old methods in raw JavaScript.

            <!-- Start by asking a question related to the topic, follow with answers to that question. Follow pattern. -->
            <p class='question'>How can I use the Fetch API as the engine for a RESTful application?</p>
            <p>
                The Fetch API has almost replaced the old XMLHttpRequest object entirely. It is a powerful promise driven API that
                can preform all RESTful methods. It can also be used asynchronously without much hassle. There are a lot of moving 
                to the Fetch API, so I'll make an effort to break them down.
            </p>
            <p>
                At it's core and by default, a Fetch request is used to retrieve data from an api. The Only essential argument is
                the url you're attempting to connect to. The Fetch API will produce a promise that will either resolve or reject.
                The promise will resolve in Fetch as long as connection to the API was achieved, even if it resulted in a 404 or 500
                status code. One way to make sure your working with useful data is to check the response object's OK property, which
                will return true if the response had a status code between 200-299. This would indicate that everything worked as
                intended.
            </p>
            <code class="slim-code">
                fetch("http://fakeapi.jsonparseronline.com/posts/1")
                .then(res => res.json())
                .then(data => console.log(data));

            <p>This code snippet is run in a script tag. Open the console to take a look at the result.</p>
            <script>
                fetch("http://fakeapi.jsonparseronline.com/posts/1")
                .then(res => res.json())
                .then(data => console.log(data));

                // Let's write it out in a way that lets me check the status code.

                fetch("http://fakeapi.jsonparseronline.com/posts/2")
                .then((res) => {
                    if(res.ok){
                        return res.json();
                    }
                })
                .then((data)=>{
                    localStorage.setItem('res', JSON.stringify(data));
                })

                // This method could be useful for my final

                console.log(localStorage.getItem('res'));

                // Not an ideal way to handle it, but it would work.
                // Maybe using a module as a object db would would work better.
            </script>
            <p>
                The Fetch API can be used for more then just simple data retrieval though, it can also preform POST, PUT and DELETE
                tasks. This is where things get a bit more confusing. We have to use the second parameter offered by Fetch, the 
                data object.
