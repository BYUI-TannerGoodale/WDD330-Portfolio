        <h2>JavaScript’s "this" method.</h2>
        <p>Pre reading note: I've used the this method in other languages before. With any luck, JavaScript's will work the same.</p>
        <p>
            It’s nice to see that JavaScript objects behave much the same way as objects in other languages. It’s interesting to 
            see in the example how they defined an object literal, then defined a property that wasn’t defined in the initial 
            creation and applied a method to it (or function to create a method). I was thinking this would throw an error, but 
            JavaScript just adds the method and allows a user to call it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wonder if the way the method is declared changes its scope and behavior sense it’s inside of an object. For example, 
            they used a function expression when they defined their method. Would that have worked differently if they used a 
            function declaration? Does it make a difference if it is an object method?
        </p>
        <p>
            Creating object literals is fine for shot code, but creating classes would be ideal for longer and larger applications 
            that use objects. Is JavaScript capable of defining classes and using constructor methods? A quick google search shows 
            that it can create classes and even implements a default constructor if you don’t define a specific one. This was a 
            feature added in ES6.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would prefer to define methods inside of my object declaration or inside of the class that defines it. With that 
            being said, the method shorthand version sees to be more intuitive than the longer “property : function() {..}; method”. 
            The website mentions small differences when it comes to class inheritance though. I wonder what those differences are.
        </p>
        <p>
            The way “this” works in JavaScript objects seems to be the same way it works in other languages. It allows JavaScript 
            to actually practice Object Oriented Principles. Without the “this” keyword, OOP wouldn’t actually work all that will 
            in JavaScript. With that being said, it behaving differently outside of objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            The “this” keyword can be defined outside of an object, but the method it is defined with only really works assuming 
            it is tied to (called with) a valid object that has the necessary properties. It just seems like another weakly typed 
            feature of JavaScript. It allows a method defined with “this” to be used on multiple objects, even if they seem 
            unrelated, but allows for more room for error. I suppose it’s a net positive in the end though.
        </p>
        <p>
            Part one of the activites will be playing with the "this" keyword.
